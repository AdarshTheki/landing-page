## Create vite with Landing page

1. The code is importing image files (cardImage1.png, cardImage2.png, etc.) from the
'../assets/Photos/' directory and assigning them to variables (cardImage1, cardImage2, etc.). These variables are then used as values for the 'Location' property in an array of objects called 'Data'. The 'Data' array is then exported as a default export.

2. This code is importing images and creating a React component called `DetailSection` that displays two features with images and written content, as well as a newsletter section with a form for users to subscribe. The imported images are used as backgrounds and feature images in the component.


3. The code is importing images (Logo, facebook, twitter, and instagram) from the assets folder and using them in the footer component. The footer component is a React functional component that returns the HTML structure of the footer section of a website. It includes a logo, social media icons, and links to different pages of the website. The component is exported as the default export
of the module. 

4. The `import Logo from '../assets/Logo.svg';` statement is importing an SVG image file named `Logo.svg` from the `../assets` directory. 


 * The function returns a JSX code that renders the components Header, HeroSection, DetailSection, and
 * Footer.
 * @returns The `App` component is being returned, which includes the `Header`, `HeroSection`,
 * `DetailSection`, and `Footer` components.
